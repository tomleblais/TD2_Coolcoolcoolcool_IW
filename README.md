### <u>Introduction</u>
:information_source:&nbsp;[MétéoConcept](https://api.meteo-concept.com/) has made an API which returns the French meteo statistics, by city. Linked with the french API made by the government for the [administrative division](https://geo.api.gouv.fr/decoupage-administratif/communes), which returns the list of cities with a postal code among other, we take the postal code with a input button, and we send it to Météoconcept's API.

### <u>Features</u>
| Function | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Input your postal code | Select the input HTML form to enter your postal code in the webpage. |
| Choose your city | You can choose your city if there is many city with the same postal code. |
| Enter your choices | When you have finished your choice, you can press the `"Envoyer"` button, and the data will load from the APIs. |
| Switch between days of the week | You can press the arrows, to switch between the days of the week. Press right to go to the next day, and left to the prvious one. |
