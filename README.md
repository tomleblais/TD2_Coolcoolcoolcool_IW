### _Introduction_
:information_source:&nbsp;[MétéoConcept](https://api.meteo-concept.com/) has made an API which returns the French meteo statistics, by city. Linked with the french API made by the government for the [administrative division](https://geo.api.gouv.fr/decoupage-administratif/communes), which returns the list of cities with a postal code among other, we take the postal code with a input button, and we send it to Météoconcept's API.

### _Features_
| Function | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Input your postal code | Select the input HTML form to enter your postal code in the webpage. |
| Choose your city | You can choose your city if there is many city with the same postal code. |
| Choose the informations you want | You can select a lot of other informations, which are not displayed by default. |
| Choose how many days you want | Use the selector bar to choose how many days you want to display, from the current day (1 to 7 days). |
